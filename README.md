# Small Evolution Simulator
A simple, lightweight evolution simulator where organisms with unique genes compete for food and survival. Currently runs completely in the terminal.

## Features
- Organisms with randomly assigned genes
- A grid based environment where food sources and organisms are randomly spread
- Mutation and evolution over generations
- Stats viewer for each organism
- Dietary classifications (herbivore, carnivore, omnivore)

## Future improvements
- Add parents and children stat/viewer for each organism
- Add 'oldest living ancestor' and 'oldest living child' stats to each organism
- Add a way to move forward a set amount of days
- Different sized food
- Different sized organisms
- Different types of food (meat/plants)
- Parent/child dynamics (children follow parents)
- Change all parameters to be tweakable constants
- Show all organisms killed by certain organisms
- Show all organisms killed in a certain day
- Show the day that organism died on/was born
- Add summary statistics
- Display family tree for organism families
- Add action history for each organism
- Split into multiple files for each class
- Add proper function commenting
- More complex organism behaviour
- Surviving organisms after a certain amount of days are used as the basis of a following generation
- Statistical analysis model that shows which of the genes were the most impactful in current simulation
- Visualisation
